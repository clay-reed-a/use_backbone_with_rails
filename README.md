Use Backbone w/ Rails!
====================== 

This repo will reflect the basic needs for every Rails project w/ a Backbone frontend, according to my personal preferences & understanding at any given time. Feel free to clone it. 

Renaming the Project 
--------------------

Use the `rename` gem for now. It's in the gem file. 

    $ rails g rename:app_to <Your-Backbone-Rails-Project>

This will still kinda be a pain, because many instances of "UseBackboneWithRails", etc., will remain after this command, but it will take care of more than a few of them.
